Create a menu screen where the camera shows a part of your game world as the background (like a cinematic scene), and your UI sits on top of it.

ðŸ”§ Steps to Do This:
1. Create a Menu Camera in Workspace
In Workspace, insert a Part (name it something like "MenuCam").

Set its position and rotation to point at the area you want to show.

Optional: Make the part Anchored, Transparent, and CanCollide = false.

2. Add a LocalScript in StarterGui
Inside StarterGui, create a ScreenGui â†’ add a LocalScript inside it.

This script sets the camera and shows the UI.

3. LocalScript Example:

local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local player = Players.LocalPlayer
local camera = workspace.CurrentCamera

-- Camera part for menu view
local menuCamPart = workspace:WaitForChild("MenuCam")

-- UI elements
local screenGui = script.Parent
local playButton = screenGui:WaitForChild("PlayButton")

-- Set camera to show the menu view
camera.CameraType = Enum.CameraType.Scriptable
camera.CFrame = menuCamPart.CFrame

-- Optional: Lock player input during menu
local StarterGui = game:GetService("StarterGui")
StarterGui:SetCoreGuiEnabled(Enum.CoreGuiType.All, false)

-- Handle Play button click
playButton.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function()
    -- Restore camera
    camera.CameraType = Enum.CameraType.Custom

    -- Hide the menu UI
    screenGui.Enabled = false

    -- Optional: Enable player controls again
    StarterGui:SetCoreGuiEnabled(Enum.CoreGuiType.All, true)

    -- Optional: Force spawn if needed
    if not player.Character or not player.Character:FindFirstChild("Humanoid") then
        player:LoadCharacter()
    end
end)

4. Add Your UI on Top
Inside the same ScreenGui, add:

TextLabel for title

TextButton or ImageButton for Play, Settings, etc.

Since the camera is showing a live scene from the world, and your UI is overlaid, it looks like the scene is the background.

ðŸŒŸ Optional Improvements
Feature	How to Do It
Fade in/out effect	Use a black Frame and TweenService to fade.
Smooth camera motion	Use TweenService to move the camera smoothly.
Disable player controls	Do not load character or pause gameplay until Play is clicked.
Revert to default camera	On clicking Play, set Camera.CameraType = "Custom" and load the player.
